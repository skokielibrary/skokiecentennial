# Skokie Centennial

This is an online repo for the Skokie Centennial book. We're cleaning it up!

See it progress here: [http://skokielibrary.github.io/skokiecentennial/chapters/](http://skokielibrary.github.io/skokiecentennial/chapters/)

## Cleaning up

1. From the respository home page, go to `_chapters`
2. Click on the chapter you want to edit.
3. Click the pencil icon to edit.
4. Make the changes you need to make (see below)
5. Add a short message under **Commit changes**.
6. Click `Commit changes`

Once you commit changes, the live version of the book will be updated a few minutes later.

## Things to remove

- More than one space between paragraphs
- Page navigation (Home Next, View and Print This Section, etc) (but not the stuff in between `---` and `---` at the top of the file)
- Chapter headings

## Things to Add

- Section headings (if they're not there)
- Images
- Asides

## Formatting

### Section headings

`## Section Heading`

### Images

```
![Image caption](link to image)
*Image caption*
```

### Asides

```
> ### Aside title
>
> Aside text that is very interesting
```

### Paragraphs

Normal paragraphs are pretty easy. They just need a line break between each one!
