Special thanks are deeply extended by the

many hours and special ef­forts so that this book would be accurate,
attractive, and representative of the spirit of the village of Skokie:



Chairman     Michael C. Van Milligen

Members     Sandra Panek Keefe

Sandra Palmore

Rosemary Schmitt

Sue Schwartz

Richard J. Witry

Acknowledgement is also extended by the
author and publisher to the following, whose help and cooperation were given
fully and generously in all aspects of the creation of this book, principally
the Skokie Public Library, the Skokie Photographic Society, the members of the
office of the Village Manager and those in the various village governmental
departments.
 
Extraordinary aid, so
much so that without it this book would never have come to true fruition, was
provided by the Skokie Historical Society, whose museum and headquarters
today appropriately occupy the old fire house on Floral Avenue just north of
Village Hall. The society’s archives, scrapbooks, photographs, and memorabilia
which have been carefully collected, chronicled, and, in many cases, at the
museum
displayed were used throughout the creation of this book. This wealth of museum
artifacts and other elements of Skokie history are also open to the public at
the Historical Society.
 
Additionally worthy of
very special thanks is longtime Skokie resident, Rand McNally & Company,
whose initial editorial counsel, project guidance, and dedicated overview of
the production of the book were of great help to the author and publisher and a
testament to the company’s concern for the village of Skokie.
