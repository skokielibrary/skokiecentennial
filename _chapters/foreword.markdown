THIS IS THE STORY of a place called Skokie. It is a place that was settled years ago by
immigrants, primarily from Germany and Luxembourg, who were seeking good land,
homes, and a place to worship their God. Most of them were truck farmers
because the area in which Skokie is located was on good soil and the markets
for their produce were nearby.

In 1888, our ancestral citizens
incorporated the village, called Niles Centre then, in the state of Illinois, county of Cook.

Now, 100 years later, we are celebrating
the centennial anniversary of that village which has come to be known as
Skokie. From muddy streets and a scant population of but a few hundred, Skokie
has grown into a vibrant, pulsing community of over 60,000 citi­zens. Today it has a
deficit-free budget of $39 million, of which the General Fund is $18.5 million.

Skokie is now the sixth
largest industrial/commercial center in Illinois. It is the eighth largest in
retail sales. The village has one of the largest and most prominent public
libraries in the state. There are 26 houses of worship, 19 public schools, six
parochial schools, and an enviable Class 2 Fire Rating (there are only 60 Class
2 ratings in all 50 states).

The East Dempster Street
Renovation Project leads the village into its second century, following the
principle that has defined the growth of Skokie over the years: Moving Forward.

The council-manager form of government has given Skokie a stable political environment of which we are all
proud today. And so, while we say, “Thanks for the memories,” we must also
point out that everything is admirably in place as we start our second century:
Moving Forward.
